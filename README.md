![Banner](images/Baby_Names_Banner_Image.png)

## Project Overview

This analysis investigates how baby name popularity has changed from 1920 to 2020. Key tasks include identifying timeless names, classifying names based on popularity, and examining trends for female and male names. The dataset includes names given to at least 5,000 babies per year.

## Skills Applied

- **SQL Queries**: Utilized complex SQL queries, including CASE WHEN, LIKE, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions to analyze data.
- **Data Analysis**: Employed techniques to classify, rank, and track trends in baby names over time.

## Files

This repository includes a folder called `docs` that contains two files:

- **[instructions.md](/docs/instructions.md)**: This file provides detailed instructions for various tasks and queries.
- **[baby_names_analysis.md](/docs/baby_names_analysis.ipynb)**: This file contains the analysis and results for the tasks described in the `instructions.md` file.

You can navigate between these files to interact with the instructions and the corresponding SQL code.

## Key Insights

1. **Timeless Names**: Identified names that have remained popular across all 101 years.
2. **Popularity Classification**: Categorized names as 'Classic', 'Semi-classic', 'Semi-trendy', or 'Trendy' based on their appearance over the years.

4. **Trendy Names**: Selected female names ending in 'a' that have been popular since 2015.
5. **Name Popularity Over Time**: Tracked the rise of the name 'Olivia' using cumulative counts.
6. **Most Popular Male Names**: Analyzed the most popular male names for each year.
7. **Top Male Names History**: Determined which male names have been the top name most frequently.
8. **Top Male Names Count**: Counted the number of years each name was the top male name.

## Usage

To run the analysis, ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up with the provided SQL scripts and dataset. Execute the SQL queries in the notebook to explore and visualize the trends in baby names.
